As stated, this example has some issues â€” if you want to actually implement this I highly recommend looking into making `dataReceived` a bounded blocking collection so you don't have to worry about memory issues. Also, it's generally useful to be able to shut down the whole process by passing a [CancellationToken][2] to your Take() and TryTake() calls, as well as any threads you create. However, the design itself should allow for easy multitasking in the event that processing clients becomes a performance problem.
