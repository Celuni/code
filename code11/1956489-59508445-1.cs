Please note the following:
 - The code assumes the data is on a sheet called "Build Schedule"
 - The code does not use the `ci` CultureInfo variable you used in the `ToString` call because I did not know where that variable came from
 - Since the function is of type `double`, it returns 0, instead of null, if no matching value is found; if you prefer null in these cases, the function can be changed to type `double?`, but the code that calls this function must be aware that a null can be returned
 - The code should theoretically work whether the date header cells (e.g. the "Nov-19" and "Dec-19" cells) contain date values that are merely formatted as "MMM-yy" in Excel or whether they contain actual strings; you may want to eliminate either the `if` or the `else` block inside the `for` loop if you only want to handle one case
 - The code does not take advantage of certain syntax improvements in recent versions of C# (in case you are using an older version)
 - The search for the right column can be optimised, especially if this function will be called many times in consecutive fashion
I tested this code, and it seemed to return the right value every time. I hope it works for you.
