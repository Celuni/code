cs
public class FooBar
{
    public Foo Foo { get; set; }
    public Bar Bar { get; set; }
}

> C# is an object-oriented programming language. And it's based on the concept of wrapping pieces of data, and behavior related to that data, into special bundles, called objects, which you construct from a 'blueprint' called a class.
