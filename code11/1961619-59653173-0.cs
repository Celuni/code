interface IFoo
{
    String Bar { get; set; }
}
Means: "`IFoo` has a **public** `String` property named `Bar` which has a getter and a setter."
This:
class Foo
{
    String Bar { get; set; }
}
Means: "`Foo` has a **private** `String` property named `Bar` which has a getter and a setter, and the getter and setter are both auto-generated by the compiler and operate on a hidden instance field.
