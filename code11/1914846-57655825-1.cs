// Reference your first library like this
using AutomatskI;
namespace AutomatskaIA
{
    class AutomaticTestRun
    {
        public void login()
        {
            // Then reach this class method like this
            Method method = new Method();
            method.client();
            // Or use a static class instead by putting a 'static' tag in class name. 
            // So you don't have to create an instance of this class in order
            // to use its methods. Then you can do it like this:
            // Method.client();
        }
 // ...
