C#
// First, got rid of the complicated generic and interface
public class Contract
{
    // The target array to modify
    public object[] Target { get; set; }
    // Index to the item in the target array
    public int Index { get; set; }
    public void Resolve()
    {
        // Change the value stored in the target array from Contract to int
        Target[Index] = 0;
    }
}
List<Contract> Contracts = new List<Contract>();
// Expected types: string, int, DateTime
object[] Items = new object[] { 
    "hello", new Contract(), DateTime.Now()
}
// A preprocessing step for Items array
foreach (var Item in Items)
{
    if (Item is Contract)
    {
        var Contract = (Contract)Item;
        Contract.Index = Index;
        Contract.Target = Items;
        Contracts.Add(Contract);
    }
}
// Later
foreach(var Contract in Contracts)
{
    Contract.Resolve();
}
The pre-processing step for Items is the main overhead that results from the change. The rest is simplified. The real implementation is a little more complex and has more detailed requirements than shown here. This shows the key concepts for reaching the solution. Thank you to commenters for your assistance.
