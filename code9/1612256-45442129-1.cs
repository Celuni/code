        /// Problem statement:
        ///     Given two lists: list1 and list2, find all the sequences of common consecutive items in the two lists.
        /// 
        /// General considerations:
        ///     1. No constraints or limitations are imposed on the two lists, so the lists may contain any number of items, even a very large number of items, therefore the 
        ///        efficiency and performance of the algorithm are paramount.
        ///     2. No constraints or limitations are imposed on the items themselves, so the tow lists may contain any type of items: items of value type or items of reference 
        ///        type.
        ///        For items of reference type, the different references to the common items, stored in the two lists must point to the same memory address (to the same object) 
        ///        and not to two objects who are considered equal by virtue of some properties they have, which happen to have equal values at the moment.
        ///     3. The problem asks for SEQUENCES of items. In this context, a single item may be considered a sequence (an atrophied sequence of a single item).
        ///     4. The problem asks for sequences of COMMON items, so it makes sense to work only with the items contained in both the lists, ignoring all other items (the ones 
        ///        contained only on one of the lists and not contained in the other list) in order to improve the efficiency of the algorithm.
        ///     5. The problem asks for sequences of common CONSECUTIVE items, so the order of the items in of the lists is important. The only items of interest are those common 
        ///        items that form sequences of consecutive items, contained in BOTH the lists and not only in one of them (items that are consecutive in both the lists).
        ///        
        /// The algorithm:
        /// Step 1: Find all the common items of the 2 lists.
        ///         The most efficient way to find all the common items of 2 lists is their intersection:
        ///                  public static IEnumerable<TSource> Intersect<TSource>(this IEnumerable<TSource> first, IEnumerable<TSource> second)
        ///         Enumerable.Intersect<TSource> Method: 
        ///         (IEnumerable<TSource>,â€‚IEnumerable<TSource>)
        ///         Produces the set intersection of two sequences by using the default equality comparer to compare values.
        ///         The result is an IEnumerable<T> whose distinct elements appear in both IEnumerable<TSource> that are intersected.
        /// Step 2: Find all the sequences of common consecutive items in list1.
        /// Step 3: Find all the sequences of common consecutive items in list2.
