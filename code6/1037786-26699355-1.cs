    // Remarks:
    //     If you are using this class in WPF4.5 or above, you need to use the GalaSoft.MvvmLight.CommandWpf
    //     namespace (instead of GalaSoft.MvvmLight.Command).  This will enable (or
    //     restore) the CommandManager class which handles automatic enabling/disabling
    //     of controls based on the CanExecute delegate.
