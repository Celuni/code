    //First, you are splitting your text by a line break. Each array position is one Excel line:
    String[] vector = textBox1.Text.Split(new String[] { Environment.NewLine }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
    String vectorFinal = ""; //empty string, lets add values here later
    
    foreach(String excelLine in vector)
    {
        if (!excelLine.Trim().Equals("")) //if the line is not only empty chars...
        {
            //split the line (ex: "AAAAA 1111" by the TAB character between AAAA and 1111, which is the Excel way to separate the columns. \t is the Regex code for TAB)
            String[] excelColumns = excelLine.Split(new String[] { "\t" }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
            //and add it to your final string: add a new line to the string, starts with [ and '... and ends with ... ' and ]:
            vectorFinal += Environment.NewLine + "['" + String.Join("','", excelColumns) + "'],";
        }
    }
    //now, just set your textbox text!
    textBox2.Text = vectorFinal;
    Clipboard.SetText(textBox2.Text);
