When called like `GetStringsBetweenDelimiters(str, '|')`, this method would only return the values between two pipe characters. Advantage of this method over string.Split(delimiter) is that it would not allocate unnecessary substrings that are not in between the pipe characters (`You can cancel free of charge until `, ` before check-in. Youâ€™ll be charged `...), and perhaps a bit simpler to use.
Test:
cs
foreach (string str in GetStringBetweenDelimiters(testStr, '|'))
{
    Console.WriteLine(str);
}
prints
