    // A Parallel Progress Manager is designed to collect progress information from multiple sources and provide a total sum of progress.
    // For example, if 3 objects are going to perform some work in parallel, and the first object has 10 tasks, the second has 100, and the last has 1000,
    // when executing in parallel, it isn't useful to have each task fire a ProgressChanged() event (or something similar), as it would result in the progress
    // being returned something like 0/10, 1/10, 2/10, 0/100, 3/10, 1/100, 0/1000, etc. (As each thread executes independently.)
    //
    // Instead, this class aggregates progress and provides a total sum of progress: 0/1110, 1/1110, etc.
    //
    // NOTE: The intention of this class is to manage parallelized workloads across numerous jobs. For example, operating in parallel against 3 different objects
    // that all report progress independently, such as Paralle.ForEach(IEnumerable<T>). This is not suggested for parallelized workloads of a single job, such as
    // Parallel.For(i, 100)â€”in this case, it is recommended to update progress using Interlocked.Increment() or a lock() on a synchronization object as one would normally.
    
    // Example:
    //
    // ParallelProgressManager ppm = new ParallelProgressManager();
    //
    // Parallel.ForEach(IEnumerable<T>, t =>
    // {
    //      t.ProgressChanged += delegate (long current, long total, bool indeterminate, string message)
    //      {
    //          lock(ppm)
    //          {
    //              var x = ppm.SetGetProgress(t.GetHashCode(), current, total);
    //
    //              ReportProgress(x.Item1, x.Item2, false, $"Working... {x.Item1} / {x.Item2}");
    //          }
    //      }
    // });
